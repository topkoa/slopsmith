# Slopsmith — AI Agent Guide

Slopsmith is a self-hosted web app for browsing, playing, and practicing Rocksmith 2014 Custom DLC. It runs as a Docker container with a FastAPI backend (`server.py`), vanilla JavaScript frontend (`static/`), shared Python libraries (`lib/`), and an extensive plugin system (`plugins/`). There are no frontend frameworks — everything is plain JS, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

```

## Plugin System

Plugins are the primary extension point. Each plugin lives in `plugins/<name>/` with a `plugin.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "id": "my_plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": false,
  "type": "visualization",
  "nav": { "label": "My Plugin", "screen": "plugin-my_plugin" },
  "screen": "screen.html",
  "script": "screen.js",
  "routes": "routes.py",
  "settings": { "html": "settings.html" }
}
```

All fields except `id` and `name` are optional. Plugins can have any combination of frontend (screen/script), backend (routes), and settings.

`version` and `private` are advisory metadata — the plugin loader does not currently consume them, but plugins commonly include them for publishing/tooling purposes.

`type` is an optional role hint (slopsmith#36). Supported values:
- `"visualization"` — plugin provides a highway renderer. Declaring this makes the plugin eligible for the main-player viz picker (and, once Wave C lands, splitscreen's per-panel picker too). Must pair with a `window.slopsmithViz_<id>` factory exporting the setRenderer contract below.
- Absent → no declared role; plugin is loaded and its script runs, but it doesn't appear in role-specific UIs.

**Backend routes** — `routes.py` must export a `setup(app, context)` function. The `context` dict provides:
- `config_dir` — persistent config path
- `get_dlc_dir()` — returns the DLC folder Path
- `extract_meta()` — metadata extraction callable
- `meta_db` — shared MetadataDB instance
- `get_sloppak_cache_dir()` — sloppak cache path

**Frontend scripts** — `screen.js` runs in the global scope via a `<script>` tag. It can access `window.playSong`, `window.showScreen`, `window.createHighway`, the `<audio>` element, and the `window.slopsmith` event emitter.

**The playSong wrapper chain** — Plugins commonly wrap `window.playSong` to hook into song playback. Plugins load alphabetically, so the last-loaded (alphabetically later) wrapper runs first, while the alphabetically first plugin runs closest to the original. Be aware that `await` calls in inner wrappers yield to the event loop — WebSocket messages can arrive before outer wrappers finish setup.

## Plugin Best Practices

### Visualization plugins — three complementary contracts

Slopsmith supports three ways for a plugin to participate in the main player's visuals. They coexist; new plugins should prefer the setRenderer contract where it fits.

**Pick the right shape:**
- Replacing the whole highway drawing? → **setRenderer** (section 1). Enters the viz picker.
- Adding a layer on top of whichever viz is active? → **Overlay** (section 2). Navbar toggle, not in the picker.
- Spawning a fully standalone pane (own WebSocket, independent lifecycle)? → **Standalone pane** (section 3). Used by splitscreen today.

#### 1. setRenderer contract (slopsmith#36) — preferred

Plugins that want to replace the main highway's draw function (per panel, per session) export a renderer factory on `window.slopsmithViz_<id>` where `<id>` matches the `id` in `plugin.json` (`type: "visualization"` required). The factory returns an object matching this shape:

```js
window.slopsmithViz_my_viz = function () {
    return {
        init(canvas, bundle) {
            // One-time setup. Own your getContext() call here —
            // acquire '2d' or 'webgl' depending on the renderer.
            this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        },
        draw(bundle) {
            // Called each requestAnimationFrame tick by the factory.
            // `bundle` is a snapshot with: currentTime, songInfo, isReady,
            // notes, chords, anchors (all difficulty-filter-aware),
            // beats, sections, chordTemplates, lyrics, toneChanges,
            // toneBase, mastery, hasPhraseData, inverted, lefty,
            // renderScale, lyricsVisible, plus the 2D coordinate
            // helpers project and fretX. If your renderer needs
            // lefty-aware text rendering, check bundle.lefty and
            // apply the mirror transform yourself — a bundle-level
            // helper isn't provided because it would need your
            // renderer's own context, not the factory's.
        },
        resize(w, h) {
            // Optional. Canvas dims already updated; re-create WebGL
            // framebuffers / reset 2D transforms here.
        },
        destroy() {
            // Optional. Release resources, remove DOM nodes, null refs.
            // Called before setRenderer() swaps to another renderer
            // and on highway.stop().
        },
    };
};
```

Selecting this plugin in the main-player viz picker (or, after Wave C, in splitscreen's per-panel picker) calls `highway.setRenderer(factory())` on the existing highway instance. The built-in 2D highway is the default renderer and is restored by `setRenderer(null)`.

**Lifecycle contract.** The factory returns a single renderer instance that may go through multiple `init() → ... → destroy()` cycles as the user navigates between songs or screens. Specifically:

- `init(canvas, bundle)` runs when the highway has a canvas and the renderer takes over drawing. This is when to acquire `getContext()`, build shaders / meshes / DOM nodes, and register listeners.
- `draw(bundle)` runs on every rAF frame once the WebSocket `ready` message has fired and until the renderer is replaced or the highway stops. It is **not** called during the loading / reconnect window (between `api.init()` + `stop()` and the next `ready`) — that would hand the renderer half-populated chart arrays. Renderers that want to show a "loading" state can read `bundle.isReady` inside a future-widened contract, but today the factory gates `draw` behind the ready flag and `isReady` is only informational once it does fire.
- `destroy()` runs when the renderer is replaced via another `setRenderer(...)` call, OR when `highway.stop()` is called (e.g. the user navigates away from the player). It releases everything `init()` acquired.
- **After `destroy()`, the same instance may receive another `init()` call** — this happens on `playSong()` which does `stop()` → `init()` to reuse the same canvas element for the next song. Renderers must tolerate `init()` being called again on an instance that was previously destroyed. Practically: null your refs in destroy, re-acquire them in init.
- `destroy()` is skipped when it would run on an un-init'd renderer — if a caller does `setRenderer(x)` before the highway ever init'd (possible when restoring a saved picker selection at page load), `x.destroy()` is not called until `x.init()` has run at least once.
- `resize(w, h)` is optional; runs after init and whenever the canvas dimensions change.

**Key rules:**
- The factory **returns a fresh object on each call** — important for splitscreen, where multiple panels will each get an independent instance.
- The renderer **owns its own rendering context** (2D or WebGL). Factory will not call getContext for you.
- **Canvas context caveat — "first context wins".** Browsers lock a canvas element to the first context type successfully acquired for its lifetime: once `getContext('2d')` succeeds, `getContext('webgl')` on that same canvas returns `null`, and vice versa. This produces two asymmetric cases with the renderer picker:
  - A WebGL renderer *can* work if it is selected **before** `createHighway().init()` has a chance to acquire a 2D context — the restore-saved-selection path in app.js calls `setRenderer` at page load, which stashes the choice; the first `highway.init()` that follows will then install the WebGL renderer directly, and `_defaultRenderer` never grabs a 2D context on that canvas.
  - But if the default renderer already owns the canvas (the usual case — user picks WebGL from the dropdown mid-session), switching to WebGL on that same canvas fails. The reverse fails too: a canvas that started with a WebGL renderer can't switch back to the default 2D.
  Supporting arbitrary swaps between 2D and WebGL therefore requires recreating or replacing the canvas element when the context type changes — out of scope for Wave A, but the restore-at-load path is a viable escape hatch for WebGL viz authors today.
- `draw(bundle)` receives difficulty-filtered arrays — never read from `_filteredNotes` or other internals.
- `_drawHooks` fire only for the default 2D renderer. Custom renderers handling their own compositing should not expect them.

**Auto mode — `matchesArrangement(songInfo)` (optional).**

The viz picker prepends an "Auto (match arrangement)" entry that is the default selection on fresh installs. When Auto is active, core evaluates registered viz factories on every `song:ready` and swaps the renderer to the first factory whose `matchesArrangement(songInfo)` predicate returns truthy. No match → the built-in 2D highway.

Declare the predicate as a static on the factory (not the instance) so core can evaluate it without constructing a throwaway renderer:

```js
window.slopsmithViz_piano = function () { /* ... */ };
window.slopsmithViz_piano.matchesArrangement = function (songInfo) {
    return /keys|piano|synth/i.test((songInfo && songInfo.arrangement) || '');
};
```

- `songInfo` is the highway's live song_info snapshot — `arrangement`, `tuning`, `capo`, `arrangement_index`, `filename`, `artist`, `title`, etc. May be `{}` before the first song loads.
- Factories without `matchesArrangement` are skipped during auto-selection — the correct default for arrangement-agnostic viz (tabview, jumpingtab) that only make sense as manual picks.
- Explicit picker selections override Auto and are persisted to `localStorage.vizSelection`, so the pinned choice survives page reloads until the user switches back to "Auto" (which also persists). Picking "Auto" re-evaluates against the current song immediately. In contexts where `localStorage` is unavailable (private mode, sandboxed iframes, some test runners) persistence falls back to the current picker `<option>` value, which still overrides Auto for as long as the page stays loaded.
- When an Auto-selected renderer fails and core emits `viz:reverted`, the picker falls back to the built-in default and disables auto-switching until the user re-selects Auto.
- First match wins (picker order), so the registration order of plugins is the tiebreaker. Keep predicates narrow to avoid stealing songs from more specialized viz.

**Known limitation — WebGL viz in Auto mode.** Auto's evaluation happens on `song:ready`, which fires AFTER `highway.init()` has already given the canvas to the default 2D renderer. Installing a WebGL viz at that point fails because the canvas is locked to 2D (see the "first context wins" caveat above). Conversely, reverting from a WebGL-active Auto pick to the default 2D on a no-match song will silently blank the player. Both cases are the same canvas-lock limitation manual picker swaps already have. A future wave will teach highway to recreate the canvas on context-type change. For now, WebGL viz should either be pinned explicitly via the picker (which stores the choice pre-`highway.init()` on reload) or skip `matchesArrangement`.

#### 2. Overlay contract — for add-on layers

Plugins that add a layer on top of whichever visualization is active — HUDs, fretboard diagrams, chord labels, practice feedback — don't replace the renderer. They manage their own canvas, their own rAF loop, and a toggle button somewhere visible (typically a navbar pill), reading public highway state via the getters:

- `highway.getTime()` / `highway.getBeats()` — current playback position
- `highway.getNotes()` / `highway.getChords()` — difficulty-filter-aware arrays
- `highway.getSongInfo()` — tuning, arrangement, capo
- `highway.getLefty()` / `highway.getInverted()` — mirror + invert state

Overlays do NOT appear in the viz picker and do NOT declare `"type": "visualization"` in `plugin.json`. They coexist with whichever renderer (default 2D, 3D highway, piano, ...) the user has picked.

**Key rules:**
- **Own your rAF + canvas** — don't piggyback on `_drawHooks` (those only fire for the default 2D renderer) or on `createHighway`'s rendering context.
- **Re-read state every frame** — overlay output must track whatever the current renderer is drawing. Don't cache note positions across frames.
- **Respect lefty + invert toggles** — if the overlay depicts strings or frets, mirror using the same transforms the active renderer would.
- **Clean up on toggle-off** — cancel rAF and remove/hide the overlay canvas so inactive overlays aren't wasting frames.

Reference: [fretboard plugin](https://github.com/byrongamatos/slopsmith-plugin-fretboard) — canonical overlay implementation (navbar toggle, own canvas, 80ms active-note window).

#### 3. Standalone pane contract — used by splitscreen today

Plugins that want to be their own fully self-contained pane (own WebSocket, own canvas, own rAF loop) — the model splitscreen uses for Tab view and similar — export a factory on `window.createMyVisualization`:

```js
window.createMyVisualization = function ({ container }) {
    // Create canvas/DOM inside container (split screen manages the container div)
    // Each call creates an INDEPENDENT instance — no shared mutable state
    return {
        connect(filename, arrangementIndex) { /* open WebSocket, start rendering */ },
        destroy() { /* cancel RAF, close WebSocket, remove DOM nodes */ },
        resize()  { /* update canvas backing store to match container size */ },
    };
};
```

**Key rules:**
- **No shared mutable state** — split screen creates 2-4 instances simultaneously. Each must have its own canvas, WebSocket, RAF handle, and internal state. Use closures or a context-swap pattern.
- **Own your WebSocket** — open your own connection to `/ws/highway/{filename}?arrangement={index}`. Do not reuse the main highway's connection.
- **Sync to audio directly** — read `document.getElementById('audio').currentTime` in your RAF loop.
- **Clean up completely in `destroy()`** — cancel RAF, close WebSocket, remove DOM nodes you created.
- **Handle `resize()` properly** — update canvas backing store respecting `devicePixelRatio`.
- **Gate on factory existence** — split screen checks `typeof window.createMyVisualization === 'function'` at runtime. If your plugin isn't installed, the option simply doesn't appear.

See the full integration guide: [Integrating Your Plugin With Split Screen](https://github.com/topkoa/slopsmith-plugin-splitscreen#integrating-your-plugin-with-split-screen)

Reference implementations:
- **Lyrics pane** — `createLyricsPane()` in splitscreen's screen.js (DOM-based, simplest example)
- **Jumping Tab** — `window.createJumpingTabPane()` in the [Jumping Tab plugin](https://github.com/renanboni/slopsmith-plugin-jumpingtab) (canvas-based with context-swap)

**Why three?** setRenderer plugs into an existing highway, reusing its WebSocket and data parsing — zero boilerplate for the common "I want a different look for the same data" case. Overlays compose with whatever renderer is active — they decorate rather than replace, so multiple can stack (fretboard + chord labels + practice feedback) without fighting over the canvas. The pane contract is for panels that need their own lifecycle (e.g. Tab view fetches GP5 separately, has no highway data) or for splitscreen's per-panel setup today. A future wave will unify: splitscreen will use setRenderer on its per-panel highway instances, and the pane contract will become the minority path for truly data-independent viz.

### General plugin guidelines

- Wrap your plugin code in an IIFE: `(function () { 'use strict'; ... })();`
- Use `localStorage` for user-facing settings, prefixed with your plugin id
- If hooking `window.playSong`, always call the original and `await` it
- If hooking `window.showScreen`, clean up your state when leaving the player screen
- Use `window.slopsmith.emit()` / `window.slopsmith.on()` for inter-plugin communication

## Song Formats

Slopsmith supports two song formats:

### PSARC (Rocksmith native)
The original Rocksmith 2014 archive format. Contains encrypted SNG note data, WEM audio, album art, and tone presets. Read-only — Slopsmith does fast metadata scanning in-memory via `lib/psarc.py` (`read_psarc_entries`) without fully unpacking the archive, but playback and conversion paths extract the PSARC to a temporary directory via `unpack_psarc()` before loading note/audio assets. Audio is decoded via `vgmstream-cli` + `ffmpeg`.

### Sloppak (open format)
An open, hand-editable song package designed for Slopsmith. Exists in two interchangeable forms:
- **Zip archive** (`.sloppak` file) — distribution form
- **Directory** (`.sloppak/` folder) — authoring form

**Contents:**
```
manifest.yaml          Song metadata (title, artist, album, duration, tuning, arrangement IDs, ...)
arrangements/
  lead.json            Note/chord/anchor data in wire format (see song.py)
  rhythm.json          Files here are driven by manifest.yaml arrangement entries
  ...                  (e.g. arrangements/<arrangement-id>.json)
stems/
  full.ogg             Mixed audio (always present)
  guitar.ogg           Individual stems (optional, from Demucs split)
  bass.ogg
  drums.ogg
  vocals.ogg
  piano.ogg
  other.ogg
cover.jpg              Album art (optional)
lyrics.json            Syllable-level lyrics (optional)
```

Sloppak is the preferred format for new features. The [Sloppak Converter plugin](https://github.com/topkoa/slopsmith-plugin-sloppak-converter) converts PSARCs to sloppak, and the [Stems plugin](https://github.com/topkoa/slopsmith-plugin-stems) provides live stem mixing for sloppak songs.

**Key code:**
- `lib/sloppak.py` — format detection, zip/directory resolution, metadata extraction, song loading
- `lib/sloppak_convert.py` — PSARC to sloppak conversion pipeline, Demucs stem splitting
- `lib/song.py` — shared data models (`Note`, `Chord`, `Arrangement`, `Song`) and wire format serialization used by both formats

## Frontend Conventions

- **No frameworks** — vanilla JS, fetch API, DOM manipulation
- **Globals** — `highway`, `audio`, `playSong()`, `showScreen()`, `createHighway()`, `window.slopsmith`
- **Storage** — `localStorage` for all user preferences
- **Styling** — Tailwind CSS utility classes, dark theme (`bg-dark-600`, `text-gray-300`, accent `#4080e0`, gold `#e8c040`)
- **Naming** — camelCase for JS functions, kebab-case for CSS classes, snake_case for plugin IDs
- **Player layout** — `#player` is `display:flex; flex-direction:column; position:fixed; inset:0`. `#highway` is `flex:1`. `#player-controls` sits at the bottom. Hiding the highway collapses the layout — use `margin-top: auto` on controls if you need to hide it.

## Backend Conventions

- **Framework** — FastAPI with uvicorn
- **Imports** — flat imports from `lib/` (no package `__init__.py`): `from song import Song`
- **Database** — SQLite via MetadataDB class with `threading.Lock` for thread safety
- **WebSocket** — JSON frames, try/except `WebSocketDisconnect`
- **Error handling** — graceful fallbacks (audio conversion errors don't crash the song, missing art returns placeholder)
- **Type hints** — used sparingly (`Path | None`, `dict`, `list`)
- **Docstrings** — minimal; code is self-documenting

## Testing

```bash
pytest                         # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_song.py -v   # Specific file
pytest -k "round_trip" -v      # Pattern match
```

- Framework: pytest
- Config: `pyproject.toml` sets `pythonpath = [".", "lib"]` and `testpaths = ["tests"]`
- CI: GitHub Actions runs pytest on push/PR to main (Python 3.12)
- Test dependencies: `requirements-test.txt`

## Versioning

- **`VERSION`** (repo root) — single source of truth; plain semver string (e.g. `0.2.4`). Bind-mounted into the container and copied by the Dockerfile so it's always available at `/app/VERSION`.
- **`GET /api/version`** — returns `{"version": "<contents of VERSION>"}`. Displayed as a badge in the navbar.
- **Auto-sync** — `.github/workflows/sync-version.yml` rewrites `VERSION` via a `repository_dispatch` (`desktop-released`) fired from `slopsmith-desktop`'s release job. As an explicit automation-only exception to the "Never push directly to main" rule in Git Workflow below, the sync job commits straight to `main` as `github-actions[bot]` (version bumps are mechanical; the PR round-trip adds no signal). Human contributors must still go through feature branches + PRs. No manual VERSION edits needed. Use the workflow's `workflow_dispatch` trigger with `version: X.Y.Z` for manual runs (recovery / out-of-band bumps).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Update the `[Unreleased]` section with each PR; when `slopsmith-desktop` cuts a release, rename `[Unreleased]` to the new version + date (the VERSION bump itself is automated).

## Git Workflow

- **Never push directly to main** — always create a feature branch and open a PR
- **Upstream remote** — set `upstream` to the canonical Slopsmith repository; `origin` is your fork
- **Plugins are gitlinks** — each plugin in `plugins/` is typically its own git repo (submodule or clone). Branch switches on the main repo can clobber plugin directories. Use `git update-index --assume-unchanged` for plugin dirs if needed.
- **Commit style** — short imperative subject line, blank line, then body explaining *why*

## WebSocket Protocol Reference

The highway WebSocket at `/ws/highway/{filename}?arrangement={index}` streams these messages in order:

| Message | Shape | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `loading` | `{ type: 'loading', stage }` | Status/progress message during extraction or conversion |
| `song_info` | `{ type, title, artist, arrangement, arrangement_index, arrangements, duration, tuning, capo, format, audio_url, audio_error, stems }` | Song metadata. `arrangements` is the full list for the switcher. `audio_url` is `null` when audio is unavailable, in which case `audio_error` is non-null; otherwise `audio_error` is `null`. `stems` is always present — an empty array for non-sloppak songs or sloppak songs with no split stems. `tuning` is an array (6 for guitar, 4 for bass). |
| `beats` | `{ type, data: [{ time, measure }] }` | Beat timestamps with measure numbers |
| `sections` | `{ type, data: [{ time, name }] }` | Named sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc.) |
| `anchors` | `{ type, data: [{ time, fret, width }] }` | Fret zoom anchors |
| `chord_templates` | `{ type, data: [{ name, frets: [6] }] }` | Named chord shapes |
| `lyrics` | `{ type, data: [{ w, t, d }] }` | Syllables: `w`=word, `t`=time, `d`=duration. `-` joins to previous, `+` = line break |
| `tone_changes` | `{ type: 'tone_changes', base, data: [{ time, name }] }` | Optional — tone change events relative to the arrangement base tone; only sent if tones were found |
| `notes` | `{ type, data: [{ t, s, f, sus, ho, po, sl, bn, ... }] }` | Single notes |
| `chords` | `{ type, data: [{ t, notes: [{ s, f, sus, ... }] }] }` | Chord events |
| `phrases` | `{ type, data: [{ start_time, end_time, max_difficulty, levels: [{ difficulty, notes, chords, anchors, handshapes }] }], total }` | Optional — per-phrase difficulty ladder for master-difficulty slider (slopsmith#48). Only sent when the source chart carries multi-level phrase data (PSARC / phrase-aware sloppak). Sent in chunks (`data` is a batch, `total` is the full count across messages) to avoid multi-MB single frames. Absent for GP imports and legacy sloppak; consumers must treat missing message as "single fixed difficulty — slider disabled". |
| `ready` | `{ type: 'ready' }` | All data sent — safe to finalize and start rendering |

Message delivery is incremental. You may receive `loading` updates and `lyrics` before note/chord payloads; `tone_changes` comes after `lyrics` when present and may be omitted entirely. Do not finalize rendering until you receive `ready`.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **playSong wrapper race condition** — The wrapper chain runs outermost-first (last-loaded wrapper runs first). If an inner plugin (e.g. `3dhighway`) does `await import(CDN)`, it yields to the event loop. WebSocket messages (`song_info`, `ready`) can arrive before outer plugins set their callbacks. Use `getSongInfo()` as a fallback rather than relying solely on `_onReady`.

2. **Plugin gitlinks** — Plugins are separate git repos cloned into `plugins/`. Switching branches on the main repo can delete or clobber these directories. Be careful with `git checkout` and `git clean`.

3. **Highway flex layout** — `#highway` has `flex:1` in the player. Hiding it with `display:none` removes the flex child, causing `#player-controls` to float to the top. If you hide the highway, add `margin-top: auto` to the controls div to keep it at the bottom.

4. **Multiple WebSocket connections** — The server supports many simultaneous WebSocket connections to the same song. Split screen panels, lyrics panes, and jumping tab panes each open their own. This is by design — don't try to multiplex.

5. **Plugin load order** — Plugins load alphabetically by directory name. This determines the `playSong` wrapper chain order and which plugin's UI elements appear first. If your plugin depends on another's globals, check at runtime (`typeof window.X === 'function'`), not at load time.
